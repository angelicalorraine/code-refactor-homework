# code-refactor-homework

This homework assignment asked us to organize the code in the HTML by organizing the layout of the code, making sure it followed accessability guidelines, making sure all links and images worked properly and removing any unnecessary or repetitive tags.
We also had to organize the CSS by making sure it was in the correct order by the layout of the html to follow easily, consolidate any code that could be within the same selector or having multiple selectors to format the code. We also added comments to help better explain the css code.
